# Find your LoRA or Checkpoint immediately, copy and paste it into Fooocus. For an immediate workflow.
# ‚ù§Ô∏è FocusCatalog (Fooocus Tool)
Fooocus Tool to organise your LoRA and Checkpoint templates with previews of template names and TRIGGER WORDS always ready to copy and paste.

FocusCatalog was born out of necessity.  
Working with Fooocus quickly becomes frustrating: dozens (or hundreds) of models and LoRA files accumulate, often with cryptic names and no previews.  
This chaos makes it almost impossible to keep a clean workflow, to remember which model does what, or to quickly find the right LoRA for a project.

FocusCatalog was created exactly to solve this problem.  
It brings **clarity and order** to your models library: scans your folders, creates an index with thumbnails, displays file size and modification date, and ‚Äì if you want ‚Äì fetches **previews and trigger words directly from Civitai**.  
What used to be messy folders now becomes a clear and browsable catalog.
